## Run Locally

Below is a detailed guide on how to run the GUI locally for development.

### Dependencies

- Python
- PyQt5
- PyFilesystem (fs)
- [KodeMono](https://kodemono.com/) Recommended font for GUI. If you want to 
  have your own, you must change the `font_family` variable in 
  `gui/src/styles.py`.
- [mod-host](https://github.com/mod-audio/mod-host)

Commands to install dependencies may vary on system. Try pip first.

```
pip install PyQt5
```

If you get an error about an "externally managed environment", try using your
system's package manager:

```
sudo pacman -S python-pyqt5
```

### Running the GUI

Running the GUI is very simple.

Navigate to the src directory.

```bash
cd gui/src
```

Run `main.py`

```bash
python main.py
```

Running locally may yield some bugs depending on the audio configuration of
your system. Check command-line output if unexpected audio/GUI behavior is
occuring.

Below is a minimal example of how to start up `jackd` and `mod-host` to be
able to navigate the GUI.

```
jackd -d dummy
```

```
mod-host
```
